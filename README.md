## What it does
My game has 3 modes - Simple, Lost of Track and Go Custom. Each is made for a purpose :
1. **Simple** - Simple image with known blocks for solving.
2. **Lost of Track** - Involves a quest to find the path to help a character find his way to Gold coin.
3. **Go Custom** - This is where users can upload their own images and the game generates a puzzle. The grid size is customization too!

There's hidden **achievements** as well for users to unlock.
