## Inspiration
As a freelance developer, I had heard a lot about flutter, but never got to try it out! I thought building a fun game would be the best way to learn flutter. After I read about the puzzle challenge, I had few ideas and hence I decided to participate in the hackathon.

Unpuzzle is to not only solving the puzzle, but find ways to surprise ourselves in the process!

## What it does
My game has 3 modes - simple, path and custom. Each is made for a purpose :
1. **Simple** - Simple image with known blocks for solving.
2. **Path** - Involves a quest to find the path to help a character find his way to Gold coin.
3. **Custom** - This is where users can upload their own images and the game generates a puzzle. The grid size is customization too!

There's hidden **achievements** as well for users to unlock.

**Platforms Supported**
-Android: Tested
-Web: Tested
-Windows: Tested
-iOS: Not Tested
 
## How I built it

I took the reference code as base and understood the code flow first. Then I made a design table of the features the game would provide.
Of course, I did make sure its fun to play!
## Challenges I ran into

* First challenge was to learn flutter. After 2-3 days of playing around, I was familiar with the programming language.
There were lot of challenges, but most challenging was to auto solve the shuffled puzzle. I had to do a lot of work here. Finally was able to figure it out!

## Accomplishments that I am proud of

1. I am now confident and versatile in flutter app development. In fact, few weeks after I started the hackathon, I even built 2 apps for my personal use. 
2. The game is my biggest accomplishment. Its totally fun to not only play, but also to interact, right from menu screen to scoring.


## What I learned
1. I learnt flutter and I am impressed I have done so much in such less time (I started a month late).
2. I learnt that flutter is the most easiest  and versatile cross-platform out there and anyone can quickly learn and build responsive apps.
3. Learnt to use photoshop to turn my photos into game backgrounds.

## What's next for Unpuzzle It!
1. I plan to launch a fun _multiplayer_ mode. Usually people skip this, thinking there's not much scope for multiplayer. But during development, I got a really fun idea for multiplayer.
2. I also hope to win this hackathon.
